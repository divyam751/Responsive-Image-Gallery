# Responsive Image Gallery with React

This project aims to create a responsive image gallery using React. The gallery features a clean and modern design with a navigation bar, a hamburger menu for smaller screens, and image cards displaying images along with titles and prices.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **App Component (`App.js`):** The main component that renders the Navbar and Gallery components.
- **Navbar Component (`Navbar.js`):** A navigation bar component with a hamburger menu for smaller screens, providing links to Home, Gallery, Contact, and About pages.
- **Gallery Component (`Gallery.js`):** A component responsible for rendering the image gallery. It uses the ImageCard component to display individual image cards.

### Styling
